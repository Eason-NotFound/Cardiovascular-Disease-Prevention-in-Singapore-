# Heart Disease Prediction Using Statistical and Machine Learning Models (R)

## Overview

This project investigates **heart disease prediction** using clinical and demographic variables through **statistical analysis and machine learning models implemented in R**.  
The study aims to identify key risk factors and evaluate model performance for binary disease classification.

The project is conducted as an academic data science study, combining **exploratory data analysis, regression modeling, and classification techniques**.

## Research Objective

The primary objectives are to:
- Explore relationships between patient attributes and heart disease outcomes
- Identify statistically significant predictors of heart disease
- Compare traditional statistical models with machine learning approaches
- Evaluate predictive performance using appropriate metrics

## Data Description

The dataset consists of:
- Patient demographic information
- Clinical measurements (e.g., cholesterol, blood pressure)
- Binary target variable indicating presence of heart disease

Data preprocessing includes:
- Handling missing values
- Feature transformation and encoding
- Exploratory statistical summaries
